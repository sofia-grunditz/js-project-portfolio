      <p>Sofia is a technical writer with a strong editorial background and a growing focus on front-end development. Her journey into web development grew out of a desire to combine content and interactionâ€”to not just write about systems, but understand and build them. She is currently expanding her skills in front-end development, learning how to create accessible, responsive interfaces and exploring how design and documentation can work together.</p>
